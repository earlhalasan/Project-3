# Project 3. An Organizer by Katy, Sam, and Earl.

## Premise: 

This project is modeled after GoodReads, a blog site that allows users to review books that they have read and add them to their own digital bookshelf.


## Getting started:
[ClearSight Link](https://great-reads-project.herokuapp.com)
[Trello Board Link](https://trello.com/invite/b/LqfJ94a2/8a2a0c57a5bff3e1d0ffb2942ebff9af/group-project)


## User Story:

- Users should be able to create their own profiles to get access to their notes and todos.
- Users should be able to create, edit and delete their own notes and todos.
- Users should also be able to create, edit and delete their own categories to sort their notes and todos.


## Wireframes:

## Technologies Used:
- JavaScript
- Css
- Mongodb
- Node.js
- Express
- React
- MERN

## MVP Requirements:
- Be a full-stack MERN application.
- Connect to and perform data operations on a Mongo database.
- If consuming an API, have at least one data entity (Model) in addition to the built-in User model. The related entity can be either a one-to-many (1:M) or a many-to-many (M:M) relationship.
- If not consuming an API, have at least two data entities (Models) in addition to the built-in User model. It is preferable to have at least one one-to-many (1:M) and one many-to-many (M:M) relationship between entities/models.
- Have full-CRUD *(Create, Read, Update, and Delete)* data operations across any combination of the app's models (excluding the User model). 
- Authenticate users using token-based authentication.
- Implement authorization by restricting access to the Creation, Updating & Deletion of data resources.
- Be deployed online using Heroku. Presentations must use the deployed application.



## Future goals:
- [ ] Connect an api to add todos onto a calendar
- [ ] Dark mode
